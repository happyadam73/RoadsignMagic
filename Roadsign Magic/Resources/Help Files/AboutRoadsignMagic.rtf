The majority of roadsign backgrounds and symbols as well as the Roadsign Typeface are Crown Copyright and reproduced with permission under the UK Open Government License v1.0.\

The Roadsign Typeface is based on the Transport Medium Typeface which is also UK Crown Copyright reproduced from the Department of Transport Working Drawings available under the UK Open Government License 1.0.  It was created between 1957 and 1963 by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert as part of their work as designers for the Department of Transport's Anderson and Worboys committees.\
